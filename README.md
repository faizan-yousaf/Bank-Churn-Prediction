# 🚀 Machine Learning Project: Bank Churn Prediction

Welcome to my Machine Learning project repository! This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank, allowing the bank to take proactive measures to retain them. The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, and more.

## 🌟 **Project Overview**
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using machine learning. Customer churn is a critical metric for banks, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The dataset includes features such as:
- **Credit Score**: The customer's credit score.
- **Geography**: The country where the customer resides.
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer.
- **Age**: The age of the customer.
- **Tenure**: The number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- **Balance**: The balance in the customer's account.
- **NumOfProducts**: The number of bank products the customer uses.
- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card.
- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member.
- **EstimatedSalary**: The estimated salary of the customer.

The main steps involved in this project are:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Submission to Kaggle

## 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
I performed an in-depth EDA to understand the dataset and uncover patterns. You can find the detailed EDA in this notebook:
[🔗 EDA Notebook Link](#)  <!-- Add your EDA notebook link here -->

Key insights from the EDA:
- The dataset is imbalanced, with a smaller proportion of customers churning.
- Customers with higher balances and those using more bank products are less likely to churn.
- Younger customers and inactive members are more likely to churn.

## 🛠️ **Installation**
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-churn-prediction.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd bank-churn-prediction
   ```
3. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost
   ```

---

## 🖥️ **Usage**
To run the project, open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells step-by-step:
```bash
jupyter notebook bank_churn_prediction.ipynb
```
The notebook is divided into the following sections:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and selecting relevant ones.
4. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Kaggle Submission**: Preparing and saving predictions for submission.

---

## 📊 **Model Performance**
The best-performing model achieved the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: 86.5%
- **Precision**: 78.3%
- **Recall**: 72.8%
- **F1-Score**: 75.4%

The XGBoost model outperformed other models due to its ability to handle imbalanced data and capture complex patterns.

### Key Notes:
1. Replace `[🔗 EDA Notebook Link]` and `[🔗 Kaggle Submission Link]` with the actual links to your EDA notebook and Kaggle submission.
2. If you don't have a Kaggle submission, you can remove the Kaggle section or replace it with a note like "This project is for educational purposes and was not submitted to a Kaggle competition."
3. Update the **Acknowledgments** section with any resources or people you'd like to credit.
